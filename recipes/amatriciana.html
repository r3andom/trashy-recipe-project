            <ol>
                <li>Boil the water to cook the pasta in, then add salt</li>
                <li>Take the guanciale, remove the pork rind and cut it into slices about 1/4-inch (1 cm) thick, then into strips about 1/8-inch (1/2 cm) wide</li>
                <li>Heat a drizzle of oil in a pan, add the whole chili pepper and the guanciale cut into strips </li>
                <li>Brown over low heat for 7-8 minutes until the fat has melted and the meat is crunchy; stir often to prevent it from burning</li>
                <li>Once the fat has melted, pour in the white wine, turn up the heat and let it evaporate</li>
                <li>Transfer the guanciale to a plate and set aside</li>
                <li>Pour the peeled tomatoes into the same pan, breaking them up with your hands directly into the cooking liquid, continue cooking the sauce for about 10 minutes</li>
                <li>As soon as the water boils, pour in the spaghetti and cook them al dente</li>
                <li>Add salt to taste, remove the chili pepper from the sauce, add the guanciale strips to the pan and stir to mix</li>
                <li>Once the spaghetti are cooked, drain them and add them directly to the sauce in the pan</li>
                <li>To finish, sprinkle with grated pecorino cheese</li>
            </ol>
